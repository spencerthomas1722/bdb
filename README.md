# BDB: The Enhanced Enhanced Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew/English Lexicon

This is an attempt to collate Eric Levy's [Enhanced Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon](http://www.ericlevy.com/revel/bdb/bdb/main.htm) into an easily navigable, searchable document for students' use.

My eventual aim is to use this document to create a Wiktionary-like interface with:
* Links between related words
* Exhaustive lists of every attested occurrence of a word in the Hebrew Bible
* A search function tailored for Biblical Hebrew, with options to search by stem and include or exclude vowel diacritics
